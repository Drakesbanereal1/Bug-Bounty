To determine all the required dependencies for your project, let's analyze your files. Based on the filenames in your project (from `git ls-files`), it looks like you're working with **Python** and possibly some C and LLVM-based tools (`test.bc`, `test_fixed.c`).

---

## **Step 1: Identify Dependencies**
Hereâ€™s what we need to check:
1. **Python Libraries** â€“ Check if you have a `requirements.txt` file.
2. **Rust Dependencies** â€“ You previously had `.rs` files, but they were removed.
3. **LLVM or Clang** â€“ The presence of `.bc` (LLVM bitcode) suggests LLVM/Clang tools might be needed.
4. **Burp Suite, Ghidra, KLEE, Z3** â€“ Your Python scripts reference security tools.

## **Step 2: Install Required Packages**
Run the following commands to install everything:

### **1. Install Python Dependencies**
Check if you have `requirements.txt`:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If `requirements.txt` is missing, manually install required libraries:
```powershell
pip install subprocess sympy z3-solver
```

### **2. Install System Dependencies**
Your project references **Burp Suite, Ghidra, KLEE, and Z3 Solver**, which require system tools.

#### **For Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
winget install Python.Python
winget install Git.Git
winget install LLVM.LLVM
winget install OpenJDK # Required for Ghidra
```

#### **For Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip git llvm clang openjdk-11-jdk
```

### **3. Install Additional Security Tools**
1. **Burp Suite** â€“ Download [here](https://portswigger.net/burp).
2. **Ghidra** â€“ Download [here](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases).
3. **KLEE** â€“ Install via:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install klee
   ```
4. **Z3 Solver** â€“ Install via:
   ```bash
   pip install z3-solver
   ```

---

## **Step 3: Verify Installations**
Run these commands to confirm everything is set up correctly:
```powershell
python --version
pip list
git --version
clang --version
java -version
```
