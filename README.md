# Bug Bounty Tools - README & Disclaimer

## Project Status & Disclaimer
This bug bounty toolkit is a work in progress. Over time, I will be adding:
- Automated scanning scripts for security assessments.
- Tools leveraging SMT solvers (Z3) and symbolic execution (KLEE).
- Web security utilities using Burp Suite for penetration testing.
- Example vulnerability reports and methodologies for ethical hacking.

Stay tuned for updates as the project evolves!
